After all, she's Birthing Pod, but her ability costs no mana, and she's the most untappable type of permanent in the game. It's because she's missing her soulmate: Kiki-Jiki. Kiki's combo creatures *are* Vannifar's pod creatures, so it's very easy to reunite these lost lovers to deal infinite combat damage. This deck has a line to win from just Rograkh for no mana, and no spell casts.",
