    "blurb": "Sometimes, an Elf Ooze Wizard just needs a Goblin Shaman.\n  Why doesn't Vannifar see play in cEDH? After all, she's Birthing Pod, but her ability costs no mana, and she's the most untappable type of permanent in the game. It's because she's missing her soulmate: Kiki-Jiki. Kiki's combo creatures *are* Vannifar's pod creatures, so it's very easy to reunite these lost lovers to deal infinite combat damage. This deck has a line to win from just Rograkh for no mana, and no spell casts.",
