  <h2>Spousal Dragon Highlanders</h2>
  <p>Elder Dragon Highlander is getting awfully elder, and after guilt-tripping it every Thanksgiving for many years, it’s finally decided to get married. That’s right: TWO commanders!</p>

  <h3>State of EDH</h3>
  <p>EDH is an eternal format with a largely inactive banlist, and this inevitably means a lot of power creep. This is not to complain about decks being too powerful: The issue isn’t that commanders have gotten too powerful, the issue is that the release of so many “superstaple” cards has a homogenizing effect on the format as a whole.</p>
  <p>The abundance of these staples homogenizes the format because every time a Dockside Extortionist is released, every deck in red loses a slot that used to go to some deck-specific card. And when enough staples have been created that whole decks can be composed solely of them, the commander becomes less important, and there’s more reason to play a “good stuff” deck where the commander(s) play only a bit part, if any.</p>
  <p>Compounding this issue is that mana bases can easily accommodate any number of colors. Compounding further, there are many good five-color commanders, and many two-color partners, some of which are pretty good. And the rest don’t have to be good because they provide colors.</p>

  <h3>Goals of SDH</h3>
  <p>The goal of SDH is to de-homogenize cEDH by bringing more emphasis back to the commanders. This is achieved by effectively giving all commanders Partner (with some restrictions explained below), and limiting the number of colors a deck can have (3 colors is the limit). The hope is to encourage interesting commander-centric play at a similar power level to existing cEDH decks. The format is structured so that many 3-and-lower color cEDH decks can easily move a card from the 99 into the command zone to participate, thereby lowering the barrier to experimentation for existing cEDH players, and helping the first few SDH players find games.</p>


  <h3>Spouse Selection Rules</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>ALL legal commanders may be used with one other commander.</li>
    <li>The Color Rule: Commander couples may not exceed three colors.</li>
    <li>The Rarity Rule: At least one of the spouses must be an Uncommon.</li>
    <li>The “Partner”, “Partner With”, "Friends forever", “Companion”, and “Choose a Background” mechanics are removed entirely.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Banning Policy</h3>
  <p>SDH inherits EDH’s ban list for the library, but does ban certain additional cards, and bans certain cards only in the command zone. The sole criterion for this is that the card is so good that homogenizes play under competitive circumstances. (An overpowered card not being played casually because the deck is unfun will not save it from the banlist.) A few cards have been unbanned as well.</p>
  <p>Uncommon cards will be put under much harsher scrutiny, as there is a much wider and more powerful pool of cards for them to be paired with. Existing low-color cEDH viable commanders will also be watched.</p>

  The authoritative ban list may be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AU-iqFXMJr1H8C_QmdCUYs6JsIlCoh5DPvEd24p4JyQ/edit#heading=h.m8ji66bzz0og">here</a>.
  The tl;dr is that the format mostly inherits EDH's ban list, but unbans a few things, and bans all cards that use the Attractions, Stickers, or Tickets mechanics.
  <br />
  <p>he social contract of SDH is simply that of cEDH: Play to win, and only to win. No spite plays, no kingmaking, no stalling, and no hard feelings. Like cEDH, proxies are not only allowed, but expected.</p>
  Flaws
  There are some issues that I think still need to be worked out:
  Blue, Black, and increasingly Red are so staple-dense that you can have a generic “good stuff” deck within three (or even two) colors.
  Because the card pool is the same as EDH, there’s still no cost to building a higher-color deck (though it’s capped at three colors, which mitigates this to a degree.)
  Over time, power creep will continue, and this will make the color restriction inadequate. Hopefully that takes a while.
