  <span slot="title">Spousal Dragon Highlanders</span>
  <p>Elder Dragon Highlander is getting awfully elder, and after guilt-tripping it every Thanksgiving for many years, it’s finally decided to get married. That’s right: TWO commanders!</p>

  <SDHParagraph>
    <span slot="heading">State of EDH</span>
    EDH is an eternal format with a largely inactive banlist, and this inevitably means a lot of power creep. This is not to complain about decks being too powerful: The issue isn’t that commanders have gotten too powerful, the issue is that the release of so many “superstaple” cards has a homogenizing effect on the format as a whole.
  The abundance of these staples homogenizes the format because every time a Dockside Extortionist is released, every deck in red loses a slot that used to go to some deck-specific card. And when enough staples have been created that whole decks can be composed solely of them, the commander becomes less important, and there’s more reason to play a “good stuff” deck where the commander(s) play only a bit part, if any.
  Compounding this issue is that mana bases can easily accommodate any number of colors. Compounding further, there are many good five-color commanders, and many two-color partners, some of which are pretty good. And the rest don’t have to be good because they provide colors.

    <span slot="heading">Goals of SDH </span>
    The goal of SDH is to de-homogenize cEDH by bringing more emphasis back to the commanders. This is achieved by effectively giving all commanders Partner (with some restrictions explained below), and limiting the number of colors a deck can have (3 colors is the limit). The hope is to encourage interesting commander-centric play at a similar power level to existing cEDH decks. The format is structured so that many 3-and-lower color cEDH decks can easily move a card from the 99 into the command zone to participate, thereby lowering the barrier to experimentation for existing cEDH players, and helping the first few SDH players find games.
