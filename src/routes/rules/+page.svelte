    <span slot="heading">Bans</span>
    SDH inherits EDH’s ban list for the library, but does ban certain additional cards, and bans certain cards only in the command zone. The sole criterion for this is that the card is so good that homogenizes play under competitive circumstances. (An overpowered card not being played casually because the deck is unfun will not save it from the banlist.) A few cards have been unbanned as well.
    <br />
    Uncommon cards will be put under much harsher scrutiny, as there is a much wider and more powerful pool of cards for them to be paired with. Existing low-color cEDH viable commanders will also be watched.

    The authoritative ban list may be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AU-iqFXMJr1H8C_QmdCUYs6JsIlCoh5DPvEd24p4JyQ/edit#heading=h.m8ji66bzz0og">here</a>.
    The tl;dr is that the format mostly inherits EDH's ban list, but unbans a few things, and bans all cards that use the Attractions, Stickers, or Tickets mechanics.
